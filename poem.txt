Not just a bow to the earth below,
But a whisper the soul lets gently flow.
Each motion, each word a sacred art,
Prayer is a bridge from heart to Heart.

When the call to prayer fills the sky,
The restless soul begins to fly.
With water it cleanses both hands and face,
But deeper still — the soul finds grace.

In standing tall, there’s silent might,
In bowing low, a soul takes flight.
And in prostration, where the world grows dim,
One finds themselves the closest to Him.

Be it day’s rush or midnight’s calm,
Prayer wraps the heart in healing balm.
No need for riches, no loud demand —
Just peace delivered by His Hand.
