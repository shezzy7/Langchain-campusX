Load is a bit slow method.If we want to load hundereds of all then it will take a lot of time to loading them in memory.And also loading a lot of files at same time can make our memory down.
So to overcome this problems lazyLoad funtion is introduced in langchain.
And the difference between load and lazy load is given in the picture

for using it we just have to replce the load word with lazy_load

It does not load all the files immediately like load method.It loads each file when needed.
