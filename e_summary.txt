strOutputParser -> we use it for parsing output generated by llm into plain text.We can use content method of response for getting plain text but when it comes to chains we directly call parser for extracting content from response so it helps a lot in chains.
JsonOutputParser -> We use it for getting response in json formate.But it has issue that we can't define a schema for our output formate.
StructuredOutputParser -> We use it in place of JsonOutputParser for getting json response in predefined schema.But this parser also does not supports data type validation.For example if we want int data type for a key then we cannot do so with the help of StructuredOutputParser.
PydanticOutputParser -> we use this parser for applying data-type validation on keys when we want json output from model.
